# Organic-Farming-Themed-Website
This is an Organic farming themed website I made with a friend for a competition! We got 2nd place for this surprisingly.. It isn't the most 'functional' website.

It's a very simple website, consisting of webpages... Which are basically huge images scaled up. It might not even work on some screen or browsers properly.
(We didn't have a whole lot of time to do this)

The design of the images were made by me using photoshop, and the programming part by my friend.
